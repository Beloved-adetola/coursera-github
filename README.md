# Simple Interest Calculator

## Overview
This project is a **Simple Interest Calculator** that computes the interest and total amount payable based on the standard simple interest formula. It is designed to be lightweight, beginner-friendly, and easy to integrate into learning projects or small applications.

## Formula Used
The calculator is based on the simple interest formula:

Simple Interest (SI) = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

Where:
- **Principal (P)** is the initial amount of money
- **Rate (R)** is the interest rate per period (in percentage)
- **Time (T)** is the time the money is invested or borrowed for

## Features
- Calculates simple interest accurately
- Displays total amount payable (Principal + Interest)
- Easy-to-understand logic
- Suitable for educational and practice purposes

## Example
If:
- Principal = 10,000
- Rate = 5%
- Time = 2 years

Then:
Simple Interest = (10,000 × 5 × 2) / 100 = 1,000
Total Amount = 11,000


## Usage
1. Enter the principal amount
2. Enter the interest rate
3. Enter the time period
4. Run the calculator to get the simple interest and total amount

## Use Cases
- Learning basic financial calculations
- Academic assignments
- Practice projects for beginners in programming
- Demonstrating mathematical formulas in code

## Limitations
- Does not handle compound interest
- Assumes valid numerical inputs
- No currency formatting by default
